        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 lbs yukon gold potatoes, chopped into 1" cubes</li>
                <li>1 green pepper, seeded then chopped into 1" cubes</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped into 1" cubes</li>
                <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>homemade seasoned salt and pepper</li>
                <li>12 eggs</li>
                <li>4 oz freshly shredded cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Add potatoes, peppers, and onions to a large sheet pan then drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, homemade seasoned salt, and pepper and then toss until evenly coated. Transfer half the vegetables to a second sheet pan then roast both pans for 30-40 minutes, or until potatoes are golden brown and tender, stirring and rotating pans halfway through.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, crack eggs into a large bowl then season with salt and pepper and whisk until smooth. Heat a large skillet over medium heat then spray with nonstick spray and add eggs. Scramble until the eggs are just barely cooked through and still slightly glossy then scoop onto a plate and set aside.</li>
                <li>Divide the potatoes and eggs evenly between the containers then set aside to cool. Once cool, sprinkle with cheese and green onions then cover and refrigerate. Freeze any portions that arenâ€™t eaten within three days.</li>
